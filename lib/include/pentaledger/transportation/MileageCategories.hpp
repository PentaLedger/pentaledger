        //! \brief Mileage Categories
        //!
        //! Tracked vehicle mileage can be broadly categorized into the following
        //! categories: that which can be deducted, that which can be reimbursed,
        //! and that which cannot be deducted or reimbursed.  Further, how we
        //! categorize the trips is important because each category is valued
        //! at a different cent per mile.

            //!
            //! Trips to the doctor, as well as other hospital or dentist visits,
            //! are eligible for medical mileage rate deductions. However, it is
            //! not every medical visit that you can get reimbursement for. The
            //! ones you can are usually not covered by your employer in your
            //! healthcare plan. However, while the medical deduction can save
            //! you a lot of money, the rates are limited by your adjusted
            //! gross income.

            //! \brief Business mileage
            //!
            //! The IRS defines business mileage as mileage that is driven between two
            //! places of work, permanent or temporary.
            //!
            //! Note, we track mileage that may be attributed to different categrories,
            //! such as side-hustles (Schedule C), and mileage may be reimbursed by
            //! a W-2 job.
            MILEAGE_BUSINESS,

            //! \brief Personal mileage
            //!
            //! Personal usage and commute to/from work.  Basically, this is
            //! anything that isn't covered by the other categories.

            //!
            //! It used to be that moving expenses were deductable, but the
            //! tax law changed.  Now:
            //!
            //! Only active-duty members of the military can deduct mileage
            //! related to moving. The move has to be related to a permanent
            //! change of station.
            MILEAGE_MOVING,

            //! \brief ODOMETER CHECK
            //!
            //! At the beginning of the year (or when a vehicle is acquired),
            //! and at the end of the year (or at other specified intervals),
            //! the odometer value should be written down.  This allows us to
            //! calculate the percentage of mileage by category.  While the
            //! IRS is primarily concerned with percentage of business use
            //! versus percentage of personal use, it can be useful in other
            //! regards as well.

            //! \brief Fuel Stop
            //!
            //! Fuel stop is where we can book-end fuel stops and calculate
            //! MPG.  Also for trucking, IFTA tax compliance issues would
            //! be calculated from this.
